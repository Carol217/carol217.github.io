    <h1> Shhh. Don't wake him up. </h1>
    <h2> Come this way. </h2>
    <h3> A <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY_HqvteVp8>guest</a>? </h3>
    <p> 
      It has been a while since I've seen your kind here. How did you find this place? You couldn't have just stumbled upon it, unless... 
    </p>
    <p> 
      What's the date and time? <a href=https://www.timeanddate.com>Human time counts</a> will suffice. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      ...so the barrier is weakening again. I have to consult the Ancient One. 
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
     Take this.

     I bootlegged it off some virtual host that humans like to use. It's not safe for you here, but you may at least contact me.

    <h3> One second. About education... </h3>
    <p>
      To find this place, you must have some mana. Might I recommend my current place of attendance, Stuyvesant High School? I'm currently a senior.

    </p>
    <h3> And as for hobbies... </h3>
    <p>
      You'd find many things to do with your time there. I dabble in computer science, but I do love to read books. Here's one I've read recently."

      <br>
      I'm open to taking some more recommendations too.
    </p>
    <h3> Experiences? </h3>
    <p>
      Much, much too many to put down. We can't talk any longer; time is of the essence. Hurry and go before he wakes...too late.
